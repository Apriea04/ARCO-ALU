# COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE LAB ASSIGNMENT 4 (ALU)

## Summary

This is an Arithmetic Logical Unit written in C++ programming language under the Qt Environment.


## Compiling and running the program using Qt Creator IDE
In the IDE, go to File > Open File or Project (Ctrl + O), go to the working directory (named ALU) and select the **ALU.pro** file.
